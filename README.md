# ai-mock-test-platform-JORDAN
this is ai assisted mock test analysis platform created by team jordan
#Problem statement:
 Inefficient Testing: Traditional mock tests are "one-size-fits-all," forcing students to waste time on topics they already know or struggle with topics they haven't mastered.
    Lack of Personalization: Students don't know their exact weak areas; they only see their total score.
    High Coaching Costs/Fixed Pacing: Traditional coaching moves at a fixed speed, ignoring individual learning paces.
    Delayed Feedback: After taking a test, students often wait days to understand their mistakes. 
#Proposed Solution:
Develop an AI-driven, adaptive web/mobile application that acts as a personal tutor to assess, curate, and schedule JEE (Main/Advanced) tests.
